# Complex Networks MATLAB

## BaraBasi_Albert.m  
This code provides an example of how to implement the Barabasi-Albert model using NetworkX and visualize the resulting graph.  

## Centrality  
This code demonstrates how to calculate and visualize various centrality metrics on two benchmark networks, the Karate club and LFR benchmarks. The implemented centrality metrics include Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, and Clustering Coefficient, Eigenvector and Pagerank.The code is implemented using the MATLAB and provides a helpful example for those interested in network analysis and visualization in MATLAB.

## ER1.m and ER2.m
This code provides an example of how to implement the Erdős Rényi and Small world graphs models and visualize the resulting graph.  

## Graph_Network_Analysis.ipynb  
This code creates an undirected graph 'G', adds weighted edges to the graph, and visualizes the graph. After that, the code performs various operations on the graph including calculating the degree distribution, the adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, shortest path between nodes, average shortest path length, betweenness centrality, and calculating the clustering coefficient.The code also calculates the global and local efficiency of the graph.

## Klemm_Eguilez.m  
This code provides an example of how to implement the Klemm_Eguilez model using NetworkX and visualize the resulting graph.  

## Watts_Strogatz.m  
This code provides an example of how to implement the Watts_Strogatz model using NetworkX and visualize the resulting graph.
