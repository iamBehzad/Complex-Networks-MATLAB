# Complex Networks MATLAB

## BaraBasi_Albert.m  
This code provides an example of how to implement the Barabasi-Albert model using MATLAB and visualize the resulting graph.  

## Centrality  
This code demonstrates how to calculate and visualize various centrality metrics on two benchmark networks, the Karate club and LFR benchmarks. The implemented centrality metrics include Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, and Clustering Coefficient, Eigenvector and Pagerank.The code is implemented using the MATLAB and provides a helpful example for those interested in network analysis and visualization in MATLAB.

## ER1.m and ER2.m
This code provides an example of how to implement the Erdős Rényi and Small world graphs models and visualize the resulting graph.  

## Klemm_Eguilez.m  
This code provides an example of how to implement the Klemm_Eguilez model using NetworkX and visualize the resulting graph.  

## Watts_Strogatz.m
